Project 2  Light Up A Single LED

1. Description
Micro:bit motherboard consists of 25 light-emitting diodes, 5 pcs in a group, which correspond to x and y axis, forging a 5*5 matrix. Moreover, every diode locates at the point of x and y axis. 
Virtually, we could control an LED by setting coordinate points. For instance, set coordinate point（0，0）to turn on the LED at row 1 and column 1; light up LED at the row 1 and column 3, we could set （2，0) and so on.
